# LogEntries
LogEntries project files

This project creates a Web Log Parser program.  The program will display various aspects of a WebLog file, including how many unique visitors a site has, what IP has visited the most in that day, full echo of the weblog file, as well as prints IP's with HTML Status Codes over a given number (i.e. `printAllHigherThanNum(499)` will print all IP's that produced an HTML Status Code of 500+, typically reflecting a problem server-side).

All files ending in `_log` are sample log files for demo and testing purposes.
